    <H1>Future Pets</H1>
    <H2>I haven't had a pet since I was 7 so I'm very excited to get one in the future.</H2>
<div>After my cat died when I was in second grade my Mom didn't allow us to get any other pets since she did not like them. Having been deprived the love from a furry friend for most of my life I regularly think about what pets I'll have when I'm older. </div>
    <p>Here's a list of potential pets I want.</p>
